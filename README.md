**Welcome to the STRONG sample marking app!**
This is a tool primarily to help Julian collect a dataset.

This is for labeling STRONG sentences. This means sentences that imply whether a person is DOING WELL / STRONG  or FAILING / WEAK
       
       
For example:

            "We empower highly trained reporters with automated speech recognition technology to deliver more accurate transcripts, making attorneys more effective and efficient."

...Implies "We", "reporters" and "automated speech recognition" are all positive, because they are all in positions of strength. Attorneys are neutral, because they need help, but aren't doing poorly.
      
        
**Hotkeys:**
Set:
1. context with ALT+C
2. negative with ALT+N
3. neutral with ALT+K
4. positive with ALT+P
